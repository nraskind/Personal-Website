# Portfolio Website
The purpose of this project is to create a portfolio highlighting my experience in
computer science and my passion for coding. The aim is that by using React/html/css
I can showcase my talents in an aesthetically pleasing way. Before I began coding the
website, I created a mock up in wix. That website can be found: [here](https://nraskind.wixsite.com/my-site)
